File Count by Date
File Count by Date is a Python script that counts the number of files in a specified directory grouped by their creation date. The script creates a dictionary that stores the count of files for each date and writes the results to a text file.

Installation
To use this script, follow the steps below:
1. Clone this repository by running the following command:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/file-count-by-date.git

2. Navigate to the cloned directory using: 
cd file-count-by-date

3. Install the required packages by running the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Usage
To use this script, follow the steps below:

1.Open the file file_count_by_date.py in a text editor of your choice.
2.Modify the folder_path variable in the script to specify the directory you want to count the files for.
3.Save and close the file.
4.Open a terminal window in the project directory.
5.Run the script using the following command:
python file_count_by_date.py

6. The results will be written to a file named result.txt in the directory specified by output_file_name.

Example
Suppose we have a directory containing the following files:

file1.txt (created on 2022-01-01)
file2.txt (created on 2022-01-01)
file3.txt (created on 2022-01-02)
file4.txt (created on 2022-01-02)
file5.txt (created on 2022-01-03)


Running the script on this directory will create a file named result.txt with the following content:

2022-01-01: 2
2022-01-02: 2
2022-01-03: 1

This indicates that there were 2 files created on January 1, 2022, 2 files created on January 2, 2022, and 1 file created on January 3, 2022.
