# File-Count-by-Date
"File Count by Date" is a Python script that counts the number of files in a specified directory grouped by their creation date. The script creates a dictionary that stores the count of files for each date and writes the results to a text file. This program can be useful for tracking the number of files created over time in a particular directory.
